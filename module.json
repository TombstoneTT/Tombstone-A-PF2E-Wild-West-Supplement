Once a fatal spin weapon is fired once (or an Interact action is used to spin it up beforehand without consuming ammo), the weapon gains the fatal trait using the listed die size. It maintains this as long as the weapon is fired once every turn after its initial warm-up. If a turn ever ends without doing so, it immediately loses the fatal trait."
